# Automated-door-lock

This lock is an electronic one, its brain is Arduino Uno (Arduino nano or pro mini can also be used), and has a 16*2 lcd screen for display and DIY keypad for inputting password, it is embedded with a buzzer. I have used a dc hobby motor for lock mechanism, but servo can also be used instead.
